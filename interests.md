## Interests  
I have a growing interest in translating complex genomic insights into actionable strategies for precision public health. While my current work centres on pulmonary fibrosis, I'm eager to explore opportunities that bridge population genetics with the practicalities of genomic medicine, contributing to innovative and equitable healthcare solutions on a global scale.
