  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am <strong>Ritah Nabunje</strong>, a PhD student at the University of Leicester, UK. My research focuses on understanding how genetic variations contribute to the risk for pulmonary fibrosis across diverse populations.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a keen interest in translational and implementation science, aiming to bridge the gap between genomics research and its clinical applications to improve patient outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also passionate about genomics policy and advocacy, and I am actively seeking opportunities to engage in these areas. I hope to promote equitable access to genomic medicine and support its integration into healthcare systems, especially for underrepresented populations.

## Research Interests
- Population genetics
- Genomic medicine
- Public health genomics

## Current Work
I am currently studying the genetic predisposition to pulmonary fibrosis, with a focus on understanding how genetic variations contribute to disease risk across diverse populations. My work also explores the generalisability of reported pulmonary fibrosis-associated genetic variants in different population groups.  

The aim of my research is to improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and inform the development of effective interventions for all patients. 

## Looking Ahead
I am particularly interested in the translation of genomic research into clinical applications, advocating for equitable access to genomic medicine, and ensuring that underrepresented populations benefit from these advancements.

In the future, I aim to contribute to global health, specifically in integrating genomics into healthcare systems worldwide. 

I am actively seeking opportunities to engage in genomics policy and advocacy to bridge the gap between research and real-world implementation.
