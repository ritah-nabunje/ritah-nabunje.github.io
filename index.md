Welcome to my (almost, but not so) professional website!  

I am PhD researcher supported by the Wellcome Doctoral Training Programme in Genomic Epidemiology and Public Health Genomics, at University of Leicester.  

My research focuses on how genetics influence the risk of pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) across diverse populations.  

Beyond my research, I actively seek opportunities to learn about science policy and advocacy. I am interested in contibuting to work that addresses the unique challenges of implementing genomics.  

In my spare time, I play badminton and enjoy exploring nature by bike.
