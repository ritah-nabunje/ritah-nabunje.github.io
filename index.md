About me
=======  

Work
------------
My research focuses on how genetics influence the risk of pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) across diverse populations.  

Beyond my research, I actively seek opportunities to learn about science policy and advocacy. I am interested in supporting initiatives that address the unique challenges of implementing genomics in different resource settings.  

Hobbies
--------
In my spare time, I play badminton and enjoy exploring nature by bike.
