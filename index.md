Welcome to my (almost, but not so) professional website!  

I am a PhD researcher on the Wellcome Doctoral Training Programme in Genomic Epidemiology and Public Health Genomics at the University of Leicester. My research investigates how genetics influence the risk of pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) across diverse populations, with the aim of improving our understanding of the disease aetiology.  

Beyond research, I am interested in science policy and advocacy, especially to address the unique challenges of implementing genomics in practice.  

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton and exploring nature by bike.
