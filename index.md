    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      My research focuses on how genetic variations influence the risk of pulmonary fibrosis across diverse populations. My work aims to identify both shared and unique genetic contributors to this complex disease, with a focus on addressing disparities in genomic research representation.

    <p>
      Beyond my research, I actively seek opportunities to contribute to genomics policy and advocacy. I am committed to supporting initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in genomics while addressing the unique challenges of implementing genomic medicine in resource-limited settings.  
      My goal is to play a role in global efforts to deliver precision medicine for all populations, irrespective of genetic ancestry or geographic location.
