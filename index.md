    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am <strong>Ritah Nabunje</strong>, a PhD student at the University of Leicester, UK. My research focuses on understanding how genetic variations contribute to risk for pulmonary fibrosis across diverse populations.</p>
    
   </p>I have a keen interest in translational and implementation science, aiming to bridge the gap between genomics research and its clinical applications to improve patient outcomes.</p>  
   
   </p>I am also passionate about genomics policy and advocacy, and I am actively seeking opportunities to engage in these areas. I hope to promote equitable access to genomic medicine and support its integration into healthcare systems, especially for underrepresented populations.</p>
