About me
===========
My research focuses on how genetic variations influence the risk of pulmonary fibrosis across diverse populations. My work aims to identify both shared and unique genetic contributors to this complex disease, with a focus on addressing disparities in genomic research representation.  

Beyond my research, I actively seek opportunities to learn about science policy and advocacy. I am interested in supporting initiatives that address the unique challenges of implementing genomics in resource-limited settings.
