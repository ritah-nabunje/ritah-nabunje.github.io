# Welcome to My Bio Page

## About Me
Hello! I am Ritah Nabunje, a PhD student at the University of Leicester. I specialise in the genetics of different populations with a focus on pulmonary fibrosis. I have a keen interest in translational and implementation science, aiming to bridge the gap between genomics research and clinical application.

## Research Interests
- Population genetics
- Polygenic and proteomic risk scores
- Genomic Medicine
- Public health genomics

## Current Work
I am currently working on understanding the genetic predisposition to pulmonary fibrosis across different populations. 

## Looking Ahead
I want to be involved in global health policy development and work on translating genomic medicine into diverse clinical settings.
