# My Interests  
I have a growing interest in translational and implementation science, striving to bridge the gap between genomics research and clinical practice to improve patient outcomes. I am particularly dedicated to advancing equitable access to genomic medicine and ensuring its integration into healthcare systems worldwide, with a strong emphasis on underrepresented populations.
